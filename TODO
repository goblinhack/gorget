sacrifice a leg / soul to progress
sacrifices are to Gods
sacrificed an arm to a god of fire, would you get a spectral arm of fire with fire damage bonus as replacement
different parts sacrificed to different gods.

the trials and battles and other sacrifices the gods put you through to achieve that.

sacrifice a leg / soul to progress
sacrifices are to Gods
sacrificed an arm to a god of fire, would you get a spectral arm of fire with fire damage bonus as replacement
different parts sacrificed to different gods.
most players would need to sacrifice something in order to get past the first half of the game
maybe the mid-end game could be about winning your soul back
the trials and battles and other sacrifices the gods put you through to achieve that.

sacrifice a leg / soul to progress
acrifices are to Gods
sacrificed an arm to a god of fire, would you get something like a spectral arm of fire with fire damage bonus as replacement
differently parts sacrificed to different gods.
most players would need to sacrifice something in order to get past the first half of the game, maybe the mid-end game could be about winning your soul back, and the trials and battles and other sacrifices the gods put you through to achieve that.
